        <h1>JavaScript Lesson 6</h1>

        <p>
            The focus of this lesson is <b>while</b> loops. We will use a while loop to print the
            first 10 square numbers when you click the button.
        </p>

        <button type="button" onclick="printSquares()">Click for Square Numbers!</button>

        <ol id="squares"></ol>

        <hr />

        <p>
            This example uses a <b>while</b> loop to prompt the user to guess the program's name. It
            keeps running until the right guess is made (hint: it's <i>Bob</i>).
        </p>

        <button type="button" onclick="guessName()">Guess My Name</button>

        <hr />

        <h2>Exercise 1</h2>

        <p>
            Write the code to print the first 10 powers of 2 (starting with 0) using a <b>while</b>
            loop.
        </p>

        <button type="button" onclick="printPowers()">Click for Powers of 2!</button>

        <ol id="powers"></ol>
        
        <hr />

        <h2>Exercise 2</h2>

        <p>
            Write a function to play a guessing game. The computer should think of a number from 1
            to 100 and prompt the user to guess it. If the guess is wrong, the computer should
            tell the user if it was too high or too low. If the guess is right, the computer should
            tell the user how many guesses it took. You can use this code to generate the random
            number:
        </p>

        <button type="button" onclick="guessNumber()">Guess The Number</button>

        <!-- <p><code>var secret = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1</code></p> -->
